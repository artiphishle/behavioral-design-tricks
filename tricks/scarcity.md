# Scarcity

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Creating urgency by implying limited stock or limited time.

## Description

Fake scarcity triggers users to act quickly, even if the product is abundant.

## Examples

### Example 1: Travel App

“Only 2 seats left!” — even if inventory is unlimited.

### Example 2: E-commerce

Countdown timers that reset every visit.

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Show **real stock availability**.
- Give honest deadlines: “Offer ends Friday.”

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Don’t make impulse decisions under pressure.
- Verify actual stock or deadline.
- Take a pause before committing.
