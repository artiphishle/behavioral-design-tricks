# Loss Aversion

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Framing actions as potential losses to push users into a decision.

## Description

People fear losing more than they value gaining. Apps exploit this bias.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Free Trials

“You will lose all your progress if you cancel now.”

### Example 2: Subscriptions

“Downgrading means losing premium features.”

---

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Frame positively: “Keep your progress by upgrading.”
- Allow exporting or retaining some benefit after cancellation.

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Recognize the fear-based framing.
- Evaluate objectively if the “loss” is real.
- Focus on **what you gain**, not what you lose.
