# Reciprocity Principle

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Gifts or perks create a subconscious obligation to respond positively.

## Description

Marketers exploit humans’ need to return favors.

## Examples

### Example 1: Reviews

Free product → “Leave a 5-star review.”

### Example 2: Apps

“Get 7 free days if you rate us positively.”

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Offer free trials or perks **without strings attached**.
- Ask for **honest feedback**, not positive-only reviews.

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Recognize when a favor is creating pressure.
- Give your own honest feedback.
- Don’t feel obligated due to freebies.
