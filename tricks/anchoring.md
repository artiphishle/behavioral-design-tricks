# Anchoring

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Presenting an artificially high “reference price” so the actual price feels cheap.

## Description
Showing inflated prices first or highlighting discounts that exaggerate savings.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Subscriptions
“$29.99/month” crossed out, next to “$9.99/month,” even though the $29.99 was never a real offer.

### Example 2: E-commerce
Listing a fake “original price” to make the discount look bigger.

---

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Show **real value comparisons**.  
- Use discounts only when they reflect **true past pricing**.

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Compare with other platforms or past prices.  
- Ask yourself if the “discount” feels too good to be true.  
- Focus on **absolute cost**, not relative discount.
