# Commitment & Consistency

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Users continue a process because they’ve started it.

## Description

Step-by-step funnels lock users into a pattern leading to payment.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Long Onboarding

Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 … then paywall.

### Example 2: Subscriptions

Incremental steps nudge toward premium plan.

---

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Let users skip onboarding.
- Show requirements upfront: “Subscription needed later.”

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Recognize that initial effort doesn’t obligate payment.
- Evaluate **before starting** whether you will continue.
- Don’t fall for small-step nudges.
