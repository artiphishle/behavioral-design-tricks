‚ö†Ô∏è **Manipulative Use**  
Users feel compelled to continue after investing time or effort, even if it‚Äôs not worth it.

Locking features after significant onboarding or progress.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fitness App

20-step onboarding ‚Üí paywall at the end.

## ‚úÖ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Allow previews before heavy investment.
- Be upfront about paid features.
- Offer partial access without forcing commitment.

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Protect Against It

- Decide **before investing effort** if you‚Äôll pay.
- Recognize sunk cost bias: prior effort doesn‚Äôt obligate payment.
- Look for apps that **show value upfront**.
