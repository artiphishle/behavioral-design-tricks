# Framing Effect

⚠️ **Manipulative Use**  
Presenting the same information in a biased way to influence decisions.

## Description

Users’ choices are influenced by how options are worded or highlighted.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Pricing

“90% fat-free” vs “10% fat” — same product, different perception.

### Example 2: Offers

“Lose $50 if you don’t subscribe” vs “Save $50 by subscribing.”

---

## ✅ Transparent / Ethical Alternative

- Present information neutrally.
- Avoid wording that exaggerates risk or reward.

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

- Read carefully and rephrase in your mind.
- Compare alternative framings objectively.
- Don’t rely on the first impression.
