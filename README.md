# Behavioral Design Tricks

This repository documents common behavioral design tricks (sometimes called _dark patterns_) used in apps, websites, and products.  
The goal is awareness: to help users recognize manipulative patterns, and to encourage designers to choose **transparency and quality** instead.

Each file describes:

- **What the trick is**
- **How it’s often misused to manipulate**
- **Transparent / ethical alternatives**
- **How to protect yourself as a user**

⚠️ / ✅ icons are used inside each trick page to highlight **manipulative vs ethical practices**.

Inspired by the principle: **Good design doesn’t trick people — it earns their trust.**
