# Market Context and Behavioral Design

Behavioral design tricks are often labeled _dark patterns_, but it’s important to understand the broader context before judging developers or companies.

This page provides an overview of **why these strategies exist**, the pressures developers face, and how users can protect themselves — without shaming anyone.

## Market Pressures

- **App Store Fees**: Apple and Google take 15–30% of in-app purchases.
- **Taxes & Operational Costs**: VAT, hosting, infrastructure, and employee salaries consume a significant portion of revenue.
- **High Competition**: Millions of apps compete for attention, downloads, and subscriptions.
- **User Retention Challenges**: Many users try an app once and leave, making engagement crucial.

These factors create **pressure to maximize conversion and revenue**.

## Why Tricks Are Used

- Many “tricks” exploit **universal cognitive biases**: loss aversion, sunk cost, reciprocity, and more.
- They **work because human brains are wired this way**, not because developers are malicious.
- Often, it’s a way to **survive as a business** in a crowded ecosystem with high operational costs.
